# Temporal variations in international air travel: implications for modelling the spread of infectious diseases

This repository contains code to reproduce figures and analysis for the above manuscript.

The code to perform the analysis and modelling for this work is set up as an [`orderly`](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) project.  The directories are:

* `src`: create new reports here
* `archive`: versioned results of running your report
* `data`: copies of data used in the reports

Each step of the analysis is an orderly task and corresponds to a directory within the src directory. To reproduce the analysis, run the tasks included in the script workflow.R in order.
